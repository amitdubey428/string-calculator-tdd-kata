# String Calculator TDD Kata

Taking steps into the world of TDD

_We will keep updating this as we move forward_

## Tasks

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:

    ```
    int Add(string numbers)
    ```

    The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum.

    For example "" or "1" or "1,2" as inputs. (for an empty string it will return 0)
