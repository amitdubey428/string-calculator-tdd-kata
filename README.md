# String Calculator TDD Kata

Taking steps into the world of TDD

##### _We will keep updating this as we move forward_
<br/>

#### We are using nosetests to execute the testcases, basic syntax:
```
nosetests <test_file>.py --rednose
``` 
_--rednose is just to add some colors to the results_

## Tasks

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:

    ```
    int Add(string numbers)
    ```

    The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum.

    For example "" or "1" or "1,2" as inputs. (for an empty string it will return 0)

2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
